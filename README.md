# Coursera-FPinScala-Observatory

This is the capstone project for the course "Functional Programming in Scala," a 5-course specialization by École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne on Coursera.

Instructor: Dr. Julien Richard-Foy

# Project Overview

1. Load temperature datasets from worldwide weather stations.
2. Calculate yearly average temperatures for each location and assign colors.
3. Generate colored tiles by applying Web Mercator projection.

# Example
This is a tile generated by year = 1975, zoom = 0, x = 0, y = 0 </p>

Note that to avoid OOM, only 1/25 of the records (randomly selected) in 1975 are used for calculation.
